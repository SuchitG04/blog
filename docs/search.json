    "text": "Hey there! My name is Suchit. I am a freshman studying Information Science (or CS, IS is just a marketing term here XD) at RIT, Bangalore.\nIn this blog I hope to share my learnings and mostly tech stuff. My aim is to help the Suchit from a week or a month or an year ago, so that people going through the same problem/thoughts can gain better clarity. The added bonus is that I‚Äôll still be able to remember how I felt during that situation, therefore enabling me to provide you with help that‚Äôll actually help you.\nWith that said, you can expect my blogs to be short and have hints of GenZ humour here and there.\nFeel free to reach out to me through my socials:\n\nDiscord - LostSquid&gt;.&lt;#6436\n\nLinkedIn - /in/suchitg04/\n\nI hope to see you soon! Until then üëã"

    "text": "We all wanna git gud at this whole programming thingy, have conversations related to that new technology and maybe participate in a hackathon some time soon, don‚Äôt we?\n\n\n\nPhoto by Chuck Fortner on Unsplash\n\n\nI know how it feels to be among so many people talking tech and you not even having a remote idea of what they are talking about. Even after learning programming and tinkering with tech for more than two years, I still feel the same when I come across some new tool or technology.\n\nWannabe physicist\nHow did I start, you ask? Well, I did not really ‚Äústart‚Äù. It just happened. In fact, I wanted to major in Physics and become an astrophysicist. Me and one of my best friends were like science duos making projects learning about quantum particles and the whole thing. But then boom, I come across a single board computer called Raspberry Pi. It‚Äôs a mini-computer sort of a thing, if you are curious.\nOh wait, but it doesn‚Äôt run your normal Windows, it uses Linux as its OS and it turns out that you can make stuff like a VPN server, AdBlocker, security camera and more such cool projects! But then you‚Äôll have to know about getting around Linux and learning terminal commands. That‚Äôs what I did!\n\n\nWannabe C whiz\nI then got another board (Arduino UNO) for no reason. Oh, what is this? I need to be a C pro to use this, is what my noob self thought. I then bought a C course from Udemy (which I didn‚Äôt even get halfway through btw). That course just wasn‚Äôt interesting for me.\n\n\nWannabe Linux whiz\nüëÄ I saw some cool (internet) people talking about using Linux on their computer! They were using it alongside Windows by dual booting, it seems. Now, I leave all my exam preparations and get on installing Linux on my laptop. And guess which distro I chose to get started with?\nArch Linux. Yes, out of all the distros out there I chose Arch (the path to masochism). Considered by many to be the toughest Linux distro to get started with. Humblebragging? Yes, a little.\nLegend has it that Suchit is still trying to customize his OS to the core and taking his masochism to the next level.\n\n\nWhat am I doing now?\nI‚Äôm glad you asked. I‚Äôm hella confused. I‚Äôm confused if I‚Äôm juggling too many balls with my two hands.\nI‚Äôm learning deep learning alongside web development and DSA. I also felt it is the right time to start blogging because bRo YoU dOn‚ÄôT hAvE mUcH tO dO, right? ‚Ä¶ right? üôÇ\nBut then I find solace in the fact that not everyone has it all figured out (at least that‚Äôs what they say).\n\nI‚Äôm still in the process of figuring out and organizing my shit. Join me in this journey, so that we can figure it out together.\nThank you for reading my blog. You can reach out to me through my socials here:\n\nDiscord - LostSquid&gt;.&lt;#6436\nLinkedIn - /in/suchitg04/\n\nI hope to see you soon. Until then üëã"
