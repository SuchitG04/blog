I am a freshman studying Information Science (or CS, IS is just a marketing term here XD) at RIT, Bangalore.\nIn this blog I hope to share my learnings, DOs and DONâ€™Ts, and mostly tech stuff. My aim is to help the Suchit from a week or a month or an year ago, so that people going through the same problem/thoughts can gain better clarity. The added bonus is that Iâ€™ll still be able to remember how I felt during that situation, therefore enabling me to provide you with help thatâ€™ll actually help you.\n\n\n\n\nHappy Suchit :)\n\nWith that said, you can expect my blogs to be short and have hints of GenZ humour here and there.\nFeel free to reach out to me through my socials:\nDiscord - LostSquid&gt;.&lt;#6436\nInstagram - squid.0_0\nLinkedIn - /in/suchitg04/\nI hope to see you soon! Until then ðŸ‘‹"
