I am a freshman studying Information Science (or CS, IS is just a marketing term here XD) at RIT, Bangalore.\nIn this blog I hope to share my learnings and mostly tech stuff. My aim is to help the Suchit from a week or a month or an year ago, so that people going through the same problem/thoughts can gain better clarity. The added bonus is that Iâ€™ll still be able to remember how I felt during that situation, therefore enabling me to provide you with help thatâ€™ll actually help you.\nWith that said, you can expect my blogs to be short and have hints of GenZ humour here and there.\nFeel free to reach out to me through my socials:\nDiscord - LostSquid&gt;.&lt;#6436\nLinkedIn - /in/suchitg04/\nI hope to see you soon! Until then ðŸ‘‹"
