# AsquirousSpeaks

Hi there!

This is my personal blog where I write down my learnings. The posts are written with the intention of being able to help the *me* from the recent past. Since the posts are written as and when I learn something new, while following some course or otherwise, I will put up the pre-requisites for potential readers to read/understand each post.
