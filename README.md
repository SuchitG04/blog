# AsquirousSpeaks

Hey everyone!

This is my personal blog where I hope to share my learnings and mostly tech stuff. My aim is to help the me from a week or a month or an year ago, so that people going through the same problem/thoughts can gain better clarity, and also provide you with some interesting content. The added bonus is that I’ll still be able to remember how I felt during that situation, therefore enabling me to provide you with help that’ll actually help you.

With that said, you can expect my blogs to be short and have hints of GenZ humour here and there.
