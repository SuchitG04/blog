## More about me

I'm of the tinkering and learning species and my current interests include Machine Learning, reading fiction, learning French and playing the Guitar! I am currently taking the fastai course where I am enjoying the top-down learning and iterative approach by the course.

I blog about what I think is interesting, and worth remembering and putting out there for others. Feel free to DM me if you'd like to add a section to one of my posts or if you just want to say HI or talk about anything else!
