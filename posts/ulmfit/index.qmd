# Introduction

## Fine-tuning

## Language Model (LM)

# How ULMFIT works?

## 1. Pre-training LM on general domain text corpus

## 2. Fine-tuning LM on target task text corpus

### Discriminative fine-tuning

### Slanted triangular learning rates (SLTR)

## 3. Fine-tuning text classifier on labelled test corpus

### Gradual unfreezing

### Bidirectional LM

# Conclusion
